# Supermarket Transaction Analysis: Frequent & Maximal Itemset Mining

## Repository Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive data mining project focused on analyzing supermarket transaction data to discover **frequent purchasing patterns** using association rule mining techniques. The primary goal is to identify **Maximal Frequent Itemsets** — the largest combinations of items that are frequently bought together without being subsets of any other frequent combination.

The analysis pipeline includes:
- Synthetic data generation.
- Data cleaning and preprocessing.
- One-hot encoding for pattern mining.
- Frequent itemset discovery using the **Apriori algorithm**.
- Identification of **Maximal Frequent Itemsets**.
- Final result export and documentation.

All code is implemented in Python using `pandas`, `mlxtend`, and Jupyter Notebook for reproducibility.

##  Project Summary

Based on the analysis of 5,000 simulated supermarket transactions:

### Key Insights from Data Files

#### **Top 10 Most Frequent Individual Items**
From `top10_itemsets.csv`, the most commonly purchased items (by support) are:
    
    ```soap : 15.76%
    bread : 15.74%
    salt : 15.72%
    toothpaste: 15.60%
    fish : 15.56%
    bananas : 15.52%
    shampoo : 15.46%
    tomatoes : 15.34%
    coffee : 15.24%
    flour : 15.22% ```


This indicates high demand for **hygiene products** (soap, shampoo, toothpaste), **staple foods** (bread, salt, flour), and **common produce** (bananas, tomatoes).

#### **Preprocessing Validation**
The `preprocessing_summary.csv` confirms that the dataset was successfully cleaned and transformed into a binary matrix format with consistent column names: `bread, coffee, eggs, juice, milk, onions, potatoes, soap`. This ensures accurate input for the Apriori algorithm.

#### **Final Output**
The script generates `maximal_frequent_itemsets.csv`, which lists the **largest non-redundant frequent itemsets** found in the data. These represent complete shopping baskets that cannot be extended further while remaining frequent.

##  Contributions Summary

- **Bophine Aime Mitchelle Tumaini** (`bophine4@gmail.com`)  
  **Data Simulation & Initial File Generation**  
  Designed and implemented the synthetic transaction data generator using `Faker` and `random` libraries. Created the initial `supermarket_transactions.csv` with 5,000 transactions and 30+ grocery items. Generated placeholder files (`clean_transactions.csv`, `one_hot_transactions.csv`, `preprocessing_summary.csv`) for structure and documentation purposes.

- **Allan** (`amu2gii@gmail.com`)  
  **Maximal Frequent Itemset Identification & Final Deliverables**  
  Developed the custom logic to identify **Maximal Frequent Itemsets** by checking for the absence of any frequent superset. Implemented the full analysis pipeline in Jupyter Notebook (`find_maximal_itemsets.ipynb`). Saved the final output (`maximal_frequent_itemsets.csv`) to `C:\Users\user\`. Conducted final notebook cleanup, path validation, and ensured all outputs were correctly generated and documented.

- **Mitchelle** (`moraaxxmitchelle@icloud.com`)  
  **Data Preprocessing & File Cleaning**  
  Cleaned and standardized the raw `Items` column from comma-separated strings into properly formatted Python lists. Verified data integrity across files. Created `clean_transactions.csv` by applying `.str.split(',')` and ensured consistent formatting. Validated preprocessing steps and generated `preprocessing_summary.csv` to document data transformations.

- **Tumaini** (`mitchenitumaini@gmail.com`)  
  **Closed Frequent Itemset Identification & Advanced Pattern Analysis**  
  Implemented logic to identify **Closed Frequent Itemsets** — frequent itemsets for which no proper superset has the same support value. This complements the maximal itemset analysis by eliminating redundant frequent patterns with identical support. Analyzed and documented the relationship between closed and maximal itemsets.

- **Aime** (`aimmug200507@gmail.com`)  
  **Frequent Itemset Mining with Apriori & Top Itemsets Generation**  
  Applied the Apriori algorithm via `mlxtend` to extract all frequent itemsets with a minimum support threshold of 0.01. Generated `top10_itemsets.csv` listing the 10 most frequently purchased individual items. Created the one-hot encoded matrix (`one_hot_transactions.csv`) used internally for Apriori analysis.
